🚀 PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATABASE Project 📊

Welcome to the PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATABASE project! 🌐 Explore this repository to witness my journey in leveraging machine learning to analyze and predict diabetes outcomes.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling zero values and removing duplicates to ensure high-quality input for models.

Feature Scaling: Implemented StandardScaler to normalize features, a crucial step for optimal performance of algorithms like KNN and SVM.

Classification Algorithms: Trained and evaluated four classification algorithms—KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest—providing a comprehensive analysis of their performance.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune KNN and Random Forest models, achieving optimal configurations and boosting accuracy.
